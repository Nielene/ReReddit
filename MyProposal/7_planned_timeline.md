//------------ first review: -------------------

* Implementation Timeline/Schedule => You have a good general idea, a bit more specificity would be appreciated. Here you want to think about the features of your MVP and how long they will take you to implement for instance.
  Weeks/Phases:
  1) front-end functionality and style for writing and saving a new post. etc.
  2) back-end and database setup to persist a post. etc.
The more you break down these and time-budget them the better. Take the goal for week 1 and break it down even more. also, these are generally described from the developer perspective (Because this is relevant to you, the developer, so you want to talk about how long implementation details are going to take) and not the user perspective (compare to MVP).
