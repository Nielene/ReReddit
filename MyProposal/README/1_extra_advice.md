EXAMPLE MVPs:
- Reddit: Users, Posts, Comments, Upvotes/Downvotes, Subreddits
- Pinterest: Users, Boards, Posts, Pins
- Evernote: Users, Notes, Tags
- Tumblr: Users, Posts, Tags, Likes, Follows
Remember, MVPs don't represent a visual aesthetic, or whatever - they represent feature-sets! What does your user expect to do, at minimum, and what elements will allow them to do that?

Example wireframes: https://github.com/coreyladovsky/help/wiki/wireframes

Reed: Proposal needs:
- Minimum Viable Product
- DB Schema
- API Endpoints
- React Component Structure
- Example State
- Wireframes
- Implementation Timeline/Schedule


Alejo:
do component tree:
app parent of them all.
relationship among components
- helps with passing props and where want to keep state
might have multiple states.

CSS
Material UI - library.
visual parts are pre-made: eg Navbars.
but will spend too much time figuring out how it works.

to get all posts by a specific tag - join both tables.
