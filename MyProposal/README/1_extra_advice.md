EXAMPLE MVPs:
- Reddit: Users, Posts, Comments, Upvotes/Downvotes, Subreddits
- Pinterest: Users, Boards, Posts, Pins
- Evernote: Users, Notes, Tags
- Tumblr: Users, Posts, Tags, Likes, Follows
Remember, MVPs don't represent a visual aesthetic, or whatever - they represent feature-sets! What does your user expect to do, at minimum, and what elements will allow them to do that?
